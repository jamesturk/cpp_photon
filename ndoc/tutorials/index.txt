Document: Photon Tutorials

Welcome to the offical Photon tutorials, they are part of the NaturalDoc documentation
so that they are easy to write and cross-reference with the docs.  The tutorials
are a work in progress, and if you'd like to contribute it would be greatly
appreciated as they take up time that could be used working on Photon.

    - <Tutorial 01 - Getting Started> - Tutorial on basic setup of a 
        Photon application.
    - Tutorial 02 - Coming Soon
