Document: Photon Documentation

Introduction:
This is the photon developer documentation, generated via  NaturalDocs (http://naturaldocs.org) from
comments embedded directly in the code.  If you're writing something with public documentation I'd 
highly recommend it, since as you can see it's output looks signifigantly better than some of those
other documentation generators ;).

How To Use The Docs:
In the left pane the public namespaces are listed, click on a namespace name
to expand or collapse it.  Clicking on a class/topic name will show the documentation
for that class or topic.  

Helping Out:
If you see anything that is incorrect, incomplete, or is just poorly described .
and could use clarification, please be sure to let me know (cozman@users.sf.net).
I want this documentation to be as helpful as possible to both new and 
experienced users of photon, so feel free to contact me with quesions, criticisms,
or suggestions of any kind.

If you're interested in helping out, but don't feel like you could contribute useful code
someone to help keep the documentation current would be appreciated.  If interested
in helping out in any way, I'd love to hear from you.
