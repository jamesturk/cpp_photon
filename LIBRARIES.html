<p>Photon uses several other libraries, which fall under a variety of licenses:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://glfw.sourceforge.net/">GLFW</a> - zlib license</li>
    <li><a href="http://boost.org/">Boost</a> - Boost Software License</li>
	<li><a href="http://icculus.org/physfs/">PhysFS</a> - zlib license</li>
	<li><a href="http://corona.sourceforge.net/">Corona</a> - zlib license</li>
	<li><a href="http://freetype.org/">Freetype2</a> - Freetype License (FTL)</li>
	<li><a href="http://openal.org/">OpenAL</a>* - LGPL</li>
</ul>

<p>*OpenAL support is optional, if OpenAL is not found, photon can be compiled
    without it.  This is done so that those wishing to keep their application
    free of LGPL libraries may do so while still using photon.</p>
    
<hr />

<p>Understanding and complying with Open Source licenses can be a daunting task,
but in this case is rather simple.  If you are distributing an application which
uses photon and it's dependencies you must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>To satisfy the zlib license that photon and most of the other libs use, 
        you simply must not claim you wrote them & not remove the zlib license 
        in license.txt, also any changes must be marked if that applies to you.</li>
<li> Complying with the Boost Software License is the easiest, if distributing
        Boost source code, you must include the BSL, if distributing object
        code (eg. library or executable) nothing actually needs to be done.</li>
<li>To comply with the Freetype license you must not claim you wrote it,
        but you must also give credit to the authors.  The credit clause is 
        the only real difference between the Freetype License and the zlib 
        license.</li>
<li>If you are using OpenAL, you are most likely dynamically linking (using
        a .dll or .so) which means that in order to comply with the LGPL you 
        must: Make it clear that you are using OpenAL in your credits file,
        include a copy of the LGPL with any binaries, provide a link to the
        OpenAL source code or provide the source code yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you comply with all three licenses (don't take credit for what you didn't do,
credit Freetype and OpenAL, and provide the LGPL and a link to OpenAL's source
you can do what you wish with your application, including make it closed source
and/or sell it)</p>

<hr />

<p>For convenience I have written a licensing template that should satisfy most
users of photon.  It is essentially what I would use in distributing any 
binaries made with photon and it's dependencies.  (Note: I credit the zlib
libraries which isn't necessary but I feel it's proper.)</p>
