! : Major Changes   (potentially breaking existing code)
+ : New Features   
* : Minor Changes   (bugfixes and behind-the-scenes changes)

0.1.0
    ! Changed createDisplay to use an enum to set fullscreen/windowed mode.
    * Added first official tutorial.
    * Converted text-file documentation to HTML documentation, allowing online
        docs to more closely mirror offline docs in content.
    * Major documentation sweep, much more useful for casual users. Also fixed 
        tons of documentation mismatches.
    * Fixed bug where app would hang if run() was called with no active state or
        before the display was created.
    * Changed AudioCore to be pure virtual with OALAudioCore implementing it.
    * Fixed issues with OpenAL 1.1 new types.
    * Rewrote circle drawing code in Pen, major speed up.

0.0.2 - Released 2005-18-08
    ! Removed InputListener, opting to move features into State class.
    ! Dropped reliance on Kernel, and added main loop to Application, Kernel
        access now available through Application's getUpdateKernel() and
        getRenderKernel().
    + Code::Blocks and Dev-C++ support, also very shaky MSVC support
    + Addition of a State stack allowing for applications to fall back to the 
        previous state when done with a particular state.
    + Notification of mouse wheel events added.
    + Addition of a State test/example program.
    + Addition of Application::setFrameTimeSmoothing ability to set how elapsed
        time is calculated.  (actual/average currently supported).
    + Addition of fixed time stepping option in Application/State system.
    + Addition of code to allow control of depth testing via
        Application::setDepthBufferParams
    * Fixed X11 fullscreen mode 
    * Removed ALUT dependencies by adding custom WAV loading code
    * Mouse move events now give relative position.
    * Properly handle regain of focus, unpause Application's timer.
    * Fixed several minor bugs. (random stack crash on exit, doc mismatch)

0.0.1 - Released 2005-08-08
    + State-based design that allows easy creation of applications by simply
        deriving from a basic 'State' class.
    + Kernel/Task system allowing full control over game loop.
    + Extensive Log system that allows full control over logging including 
        various log levels and three built in forms of output, with the ability 
        to add custom output formats.
    + A wide variety of helper utilities for tasks such as filesystem 
        navigation, FileBuffer capable of reading from archives, random number 
        generation, versioning, and timing
    + Powerful input system allowing for direct access to keyboard/mouse status
        or passive listeners which are notified of events when they occur.
    + Resource Management system including the ability to load resources from 
        specified directories or archives.
    + Variety of math classes including Circle, Rectangle, and Vector classes 
        convinient for game use
    + ConfigFile class for reading/writing INI-style files for game settings
    + OpenGL management including ability to set video mode, and easy management
        of multiple viewports
    + Resource-managed Texture class allowing for loading of textures for use in
        OpenGL
    + Image class that extends Texture class, allowing for hardware accellerated
        drawing, rotation, scaling, and blending of images for use in 2D 
        environments
    + Resource-managed Font class allowing for the rendering of text using 
        TrueType fonts
    + Primitive-drawing ‘Pen’ class allowing for drawing of various geometric 
        shapes, lines, and vectors.
    + OpenAL based sound system*
    + Entire library is built in a highly-modular fashion with extensibility in 
        mind. Use of modern programming techniques like templates and exceptions
        contributes to ease of use and ease of development.
    + 12 demo programs showing features and ease of use of various components.
