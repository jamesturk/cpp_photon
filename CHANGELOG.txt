0.0.1 - Released 2005-08-08
    + State-based design that allows easy creation of applications by simply
        deriving from a basic 'State' class.
    + Kernel/Task system allowing full control over game loop.
    + Extensive Log system that allows full control over logging including 
        various log levels and three built in forms of output, with the ability 
        to add custom output formats.
    + A wide variety of helper utilities for tasks such as filesystem 
        navigation, FileBuffer capable of reading from archives, random number 
        generation, versioning, and timing
    + Powerful input system allowing for direct access to keyboard/mouse status
        or passive listeners which are notified of events when they occur.
    + Resource Management system including the ability to load resources from 
        specified directories or archives.
    + Variety of math classes including Circle, Rectangle, and Vector classes 
        convinient for game use
    + ConfigFile class for reading/writing INI-style files for game settings
    + OpenGL management including ability to set video mode, and easy management
        of multiple viewports
    + Resource-managed Texture class allowing for loading of textures for use in
        OpenGL
    + Image class that extends Texture class, allowing for hardware accellerated
        drawing, rotation, scaling, and blending of images for use in 2D 
        environments
    + Resource-managed Font class allowing for the rendering of text using 
        TrueType fonts
    + Primitive-drawing ‘Pen’ class allowing for drawing of various geometric 
        shapes, lines, and vectors.
    + OpenAL based sound system*
    + Entire library is built in a highly-modular fashion with extensibility in 
        mind. Use of modern programming techniques like templates and exceptions
        contributes to ease of use and ease of development.
    + 12 demo programs showing features and ease of use of various components.
