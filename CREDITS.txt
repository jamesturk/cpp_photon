In addition, I'd like to thank:
    * Sean and Gamer Tazar from the old CoZ team, where ZEngine was born
    * Everyone who contributed to, used, or downloaded ZEngine
    * Sam Lantinga and the rest of the SDL crew (without SDL, no ZEngine, 
        without ZEngine, no photon)
    * The GameDev.net community for answering my (often complex) questions
    * Richard 'Superpig' Fine for his Enginuity articles, which influenced my
        Kernel/Task design.
    * Jesse Maurais and DevMaster.net for the OpenAL tutorials
    * Everyone responsible for FreeMind (http://freemind.sf.net)
