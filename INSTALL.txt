Building Photon requires the SCons (http://www.scons.org) build tool.

    1) Enter the photon directory.
    2) Type 'scons' - building should begin assuming all dependencies are found.
        this will result in the photon library being built in the lib/ folder.
    3) Optional: Type 'scons test' to build test programs, test programs will be
        built in the test/ folder.
    4) Optional: Type 'scons docs' to build documentation in the docs/ folder.
        [requires NaturalDocs (http://naturaldocs.org)]
