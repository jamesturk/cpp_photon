There are several ways to build photon:
    - SCons Build Tool                  http://www.scons.org
    - Dev-C++ 5 Windows IDE             http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html
    - Code::Blocks Windows/Linux IDE    http://codeblocks.org

Building with SCons
    1) Enter the photon directory.
    2) Type 'scons' - building should begin assuming all dependencies are found.
        this will result in the photon library being built in the lib/ folder.
    3) Optional: Type 'scons test' to build test programs, test programs will be
        built in the test/ folder.
    4) Optional: Type 'scons docs' to build documentation in the docs/ folder.
        [requires NaturalDocs (http://naturaldocs.org)]
    5) Copy the photon library from the lib/ folder and the contents of photon's
        include/ directory to somewhere in your compilers search path.  
        
Building with Dev-C++
    1) Run the photon.dev project in the devcpp directory, building libphoton.a
    2) Optional: Build any tests by running the other projects in the devcpp
        directory.
    3) Copy the photon library from the lib/ folder and the contents of photon's
        include/ directory to somewhere in your compilers search path.  

Building with Code::Blocks
    1) Open the photon.workspace file in Code::Blocks
    2) Build the library by compiling the project named photon.
    3) Optional: Build any tests by running the other projects.
    4) Copy the photon library from the lib/ folder and the contents of photon's
        include/ directory to somewhere in your compilers search path.
