These project files are currently unsupported, as is building in MSVC as I 
simply don't have time to test in MSVC which can be rather difficult since all
development takes place using gcc.

If you'd like to help out with MSVC support it would be greatly appreciated.
Please contact James <cozman@users.sf.net> if you're interested.
